#Project 1: Exploratory Data Analysis

# Requirements
# Describe your data
# Perform exploratory analysis methods with visualization and statistical analysis
# Use MatPlotLib and Tableau to create visualizations
# Use NumPy to apply basic summary statistics: mean, median, mode
# Determine if dataset appears to follow a normal distribution
# Bonus:
# Recreate all of your MatPlotLib graphs in Tableau
# Recreate all of your MatPlotLib graphs in Seaborn
# Create a blog post describing your data, analysis, and approach.

# Step 1: Open the sat_scores.csv file. Investigate the data, and answer the questions below.
print("\
1. What does the data describe?\n\
2. Does the data look complete? Are there any obvious issues with the observations?\n\
3. Create a data dictionary for the dataset.\n\
")
# Step 2: Load the data.
# 4. Load the data into a list of lists
# In [ ]:
#
# 5. Print the data
# In [ ]:
#
# 6. Extract a list of the labels from the data, and remove them from the data.
# In [ ]:
#
# 7. Create a list of State names extracted from the data. (Hint: use the list of labels to index on the State column)
# In [ ]:
#
# 8. Print the types of each column
# In [ ]:
#
# 9. Do any types need to be reassigned? If so, go ahead and do it.
# In [ ]:
#
# 10. Create a dictionary for each column mapping the State to its respective value for that column.
# In [ ]:
#
# Step 3: Describe the data
# 12. Print the min and max of each column
# In [ ]:
#
# 13. Write a function using only list comprehensions, no loops, to compute Standard Deviation. Print the Standard Deviation of each numeric column.
# In [ ]:
#
# Step 4: Visualize the data
# 14. Using MatPlotLib and PyPlot, plot the distribution of the Rate using histograms.
# In [ ]:
#
# 15. Plot the Math distribution
# In [ ]:
#
# 16. Plot the Verbal distribution
# In [ ]:
#
# 17. What is the typical assumption for data distribution?
# In [ ]:
#
# 18. Does that distribution hold true for our data?
# In [ ]:
#
# 19. Plot some scatterplots. BONUS: Use a PyPlot figure to present multiple plots at once.
# In [ ]:
#
# 20. Are there any interesting relationships to note?
# In [ ]:
#
# 21. Create box plots for each variable.
# In [ ]:
#
# BONUS: Using Tableau, create a heat map for each variable using a map of the US.
